              <span>
                Traditionally, Abayas are black, however, women wear different
                colours to express themselves fashionably. Since the Abaya is
                the only garment seen on those that wear it, with time, it has
                evolved to make a fashion statement for women. CloudTailor can
                adorn your Abayas with beautiful embellishments and craft them
                into many different designs.

              <span>
                Earlier, the blouse was made from the same fabric as the sari.
                Many sarees came with the excess fabric at the end so that it
                could be cut off and made into a matching choli. In the modern
                times, designers have reimagined the blouse. With CloudTailor’s
                online tailoring service, you can get innovative necklines,
                sleeve styles, embroidery, sequins etc. and turn your blouse
                into a designer masterpiece.
